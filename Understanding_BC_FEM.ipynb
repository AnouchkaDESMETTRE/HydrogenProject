    "This notebook outlines a structured approach to understanding and implementing boundary conditions (BCs) in numerical simulations. O\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Hand-Coding Linear Dirichlet Boundary Conditions:** We will start by examining how existing libraries typically apply linear Dirichlet BCs, where a specific degree of freedom $\\mathbf{u}_i$ is set to a fixed value $C$ (i.e., $\\mathbf{u}_i = C$). Our focus will be on understanding how this condition translates into direct modifications of the global stiffness matrix $\\mathbf{K}$ and the right-hand side vector $\\mathbf{f}$. We will then proceed to \"hand-code\" this modification ourselves, learning how specific rows and columns of these matrices are altered to impose the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Implementing Affine Constraints:** Building upon the understanding of linear Dirichlet conditions, we will extend our capabilities to more general **affine constraints**. These are linear relationships involving multiple degrees of freedom, expressed as $\\sum_{j} a_j \\mathbf{u}_j = C$. A common example is enforcing a mean value constraint on a field variable over a certain region. This step will further develop our intuition for how linear dependencies are embedded within the algebraic system.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Extending to Nonlinear Boundary Conditions via Newton's Method:** Finally, we will apply the insights gained from handling linear constraints to the realm of nonlinear boundary conditions. For a nonlinear problem, the governing equations, including boundary conditions, form a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{u}) = \\mathbf{0}$. We will solve this system using the Newton-Raphson method, which relies on solving a linearized system at each iteration: $J(\\mathbf{u}^k) \\mathbf{\\delta u} = -\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{u}^k)$. Here, $J(\\mathbf{u}^k)$ is the Jacobian matrix. Our key focus will be on how the nonlinear boundary condition (e.g., $[\\rho_g(0)]^2 = 2$ from our previous work) is integrated into the residual function $\\mathbf{F}(\\mathbf{u})$ and, crucially, how its linearization appears within the Jacobian $J(\\mathbf{u})$. This consolidates the understanding that even a nonlinear boundary condition translates to a linear contribution to the Jacobian system solved at each Newton iteration."

Specifically, we will investigate how the system matrix $K$ and the right-hand side vector $f$ are directly modified. The goal is to explicitly \"hand-code\" the implementation of this Dirichlet boundary condition. This means we will bypass the high-level `applybc!` function for the Dirichlet constraint and instead directly manipulate the relevant row(s) of the discretized matrix and vector to enforce the condition $\\rho_g(z_{boundary}) = C$. This exercise will provide a granular understanding of the algebraic changes required to impose such constraints."
