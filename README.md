This study numerically investigated the hydrogen absorption and desorption processes in a long tubular LaNi5 metal hydride tank (MHT) integrated with a Rubitherm phase change material (PCM) jacket for PEM fuel cell hydrogen supply. This numerical study was carried out to address the practical aspects of hydrogen absorption and desorption processes in a long tubular LaNi5 metal hydride tank (MHT) integrated with a Rubitherm phase change material (PCM) jacket for hydrogen supplying of PEM fuel cell. The article is published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy.

The authors analyzed the influence of different H2 supply pressures (10, 15, 20 bar), different discharge pressures (1.5, 1.75, 2 bar) and metal hydride bed porosities (0.4, 0.5 and 0.6) on transient and local temperature distributions across the H2-MHT system and PCM jacket. The time-dependent changes of hydrogen to metal (H/M) ratio and PCM melt fraction were also investigated until they reach equilibrium.

Key findings include:
*   It was found that system temperature, PCM melt fraction and H/M ratio reach steady state with different rates, such that systems with higher supply pressure in absorption, lower discharge pressure in desorption and higher bed porosity approach steady state faster.
*   Up to the steady state, 64%, 79% and 91% of the initial volume of solid PCM liquefies in absorption and 67%, 83% and 95% of liquid PCM solidifies in desorption for bed porosities of 0.6, 0.5 and 0.4, respectively.
*   The MHT is charged with hydrogen much faster under high supply pressures. Also, it is discharged much faster under lower discharge pressure.
*   Inserting metal foam in the PCM jacket enhances the thermal conductivity, and significantly reduces the charging and discharging time.
*   PCM melt fraction and H/M ratio reached steady state at different rates during absorption.
*   Full discharge times during desorption varied significantly with discharge pressure.
*   Increasing bed porosity led to faster hydrogen charging but a decrease in H/M ratio during desorption.

The study concluded that the operating parameters and bed properties significantly affect system performance, and that integrating metal foam into the PCM is an effective strategy for improving heat transfer and reducing cycle times. The findings are crucial for the design and optimization of metal hydride-based hydrogen storage systems.
