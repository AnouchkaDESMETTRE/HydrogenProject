The article titled "**Absorption and desorption of hydrogen in long metal hydride tank equipped with phase change material jacket**" was published in the International Journal of Hydrogen Energy in **April 2016** and was authored by **A. Ali Rabienataj Darzi, H. Hassanzadeh Afrouzi, A. Moshfegh, and M. Farhadi**. The DOI is 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2016.04.051. We are reviewing this study to understand its findings for application in our own research or projects.

This study numerically investigated the **hydrogen absorption and desorption processes** in a long tubular **LaNi5 metal hydride tank (MHT)** integrated with a **Rubitherm phase change material (PCM) jacket** for PEM fuel cell hydrogen supply. The authors analyzed the influence of different **H2 supply pressures (10, 15, and 20 bar)**, different **discharge pressures (1.5, 1.75, and 2 bar)**, and **metal hydride bed porosities (0.4, 0.5, and 0.6)** on transient and local temperature distributions across the H2-MHT system and PCM jacket. The time-dependent changes of the **hydrogen to metal (H/M) ratio** and **PCM melt fraction** were also investigated until equilibrium was reached.

Key findings of the study include:

*   It was found that **system temperature, PCM melt fraction, and H/M ratio reach steady state at different rates**. Systems with **higher supply pressure in absorption, lower discharge pressure in desorption, and higher bed porosity** approach steady state faster.
*   The **MHT charges with hydrogen much faster under high supply pressures** and **discharges much faster under lower discharge pressures**.
*   Inserting **metal foam in the PCM jacket enhances thermal conductivity** and **significantly reduces the charging and discharging time**.
*   **PCM melt fraction and H/M ratio reached steady state at different rates during absorption**. The H/M ratio approaches unity (full saturation) quicker at high supply pressures, indicating a shorter charging time.
*   The **full discharge times** during desorption occurred at 300, 420, and 600 minutes for discharge pressures of 1.5, 1.75, and 2 bars, respectively. Systems with lower discharge pressure approach steady state faster.
*   Increasing the **bed porosity led to faster hydrogen charging** but a **decrease in H/M ratio during desorption**. Higher bed porosity leads to a lower PCM melt fraction but faster equilibrium. Lower porosity means a higher amount of hydride mass requiring more heat for release during desorption.
*   Inserting metal foam in the PCM jacket enhances the melting and solidification rate of the PCM, desirably reducing the charging and discharging times.

The study concluded that the operating parameters and bed properties significantly affect system performance, and that integrating metal foam into the PCM is an effective strategy for improving heat transfer and reducing cycle times.
